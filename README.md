# heap-hw
A binary heap is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap ordering property.There are two type of heaps: max heap and min heap.For max heap, the value of each parent node is greater than the value of its child nodes. For a min heap, the value of each parent node is less than the value of its child nodes. Heaps are useful for priority queues. Heaps give you quick access to the largest or smallest item in heap, but the rest of the data remains somewhat unsorted. To transform a python list to a heap, you use the function heapify().
